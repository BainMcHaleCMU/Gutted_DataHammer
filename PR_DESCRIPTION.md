## Technical Details

The implementation removes simulated data and replaces it with a robust framework for model training that:

1. Validates input data and datasets
2. Determines appropriate model types based on data characteristics
3. Selects relevant features for each model
4. Determines appropriate hyperparameters based on model type and dataset size
5. Provides a framework for actual model training
6. Handles errors at multiple levels with detailed error messages
7. Returns structured results with model metadata and performance metrics

## Benefits

These changes make the ModelingTaskAgent more resilient to:
- Different data formats
- Missing or invalid information
- Edge cases in data processing
- Errors during model training

While providing:
- Better error reporting
- More detailed logging
- More intelligent model selection
- More appropriate feature selection
- Better visualization suggestions
